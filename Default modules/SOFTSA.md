# Module Name: Soft Copyleft/Share-Alike (SOFTSA)

## 1. Basic Content

Derivative works created by forking the original repository must be licensed under the same or compatible terms as the original work. This means that any modifications, additions, or distributions made to forks of the software must also be subject to the same copyleft/share-alike terms.

However, projects that merely use the library within the scope of quotation rights under their respective copyright laws are exempt from this obligation. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Invoking the library's functionality through its defined API using import statements, using directives, or equivalent mechanisms in various programming languages, as long as the library code is not substantially replicated or wrapped.
- Using snippets of the library's code for criticism, review, research, or other purposes permitted under the quotation rights, as long as the snippets are properly attributed to the original library and do not exceed the reasonable extent necessary for the purpose.

In cases where the use of the library does not fall under the quotation rights, the project must comply with the copyleft/share-alike terms of this license, unless otherwise permitted by applicable copyright laws.

The copyleft/share-alike terms do not extend to the using project as a whole, as long as the library is used as intended and within the quotation rights or other applicable copyright exceptions.

For example, if a project imports the library and calls its functions without modifying or redistributing the library itself, the project does not need to adopt the SOFTSA terms. However, if the project forks the library and distributes a modified version, the SOFTSA terms apply to the fork.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
- THIS MODULE CANNOT BE USED IN SECTION 5 (OPTIONAL INHERITANCE CONDITIONS).
- WHEN THIS MODULE IS USED, ALL MODULES ORIGINALLY PRESENT IN SECTION 5 ARE AUTOMATICALLY TREATED AS IF THEY WERE IN SECTION 2 (MANDATORY INHERITANCE CONDITIONS).
- FAILURE TO PROPERLY MOVE THE MODULES WILL RESULT IN THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MODULE.
- ANY ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT THE COPYLEFT/SHARE-ALIKE OBLIGATIONS BY REPLICATING OR WRAPPING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE LIBRARY'S FUNCTIONALITY MAY BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF THE LICENSE TERMS, UNLESS SUCH USE IS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAWS.

## 2. Mandatory Inheritance (Section 2) Usage

Can be used in Section 2: Yes

Examples of allowed inheritance structures:
- Originating repository (includes SOFTSA) -> Direct fork (must include SOFTSA) -> Subsequent forks (must include SOFTSA)

When used in Section 2, the SOFTSA terms are mandatory for repositories that fork the library.

## 3. Optional Inheritance (Section 5) Usage

Can be used in Section 5: No

This module is designed for mandatory inheritance on forks and therefore cannot be used in the optional inheritance section.
