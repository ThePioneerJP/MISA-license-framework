# Module Name: Naming Continuity Obligation (NCO)

## 1. Basic Content

Any derivative works or forks of this product, regardless of any additional licenses applied, must retain the name of the originating repository at the point of forking. This naming continuity obligation must be inherited by any subsequent forks or derivative works.

The retained name should be placed at the beginning of the derivative work's name. If any modifications are made to the name, the modified part should be clearly indicated after a hyphen ("-").

There is no retroactive renaming obligation (although voluntary updates are not prohibited). Inheritance of the retained name should be based on the parent generation's retained portion, but tracing back to the origin is also permitted.

## 2. Mandatory Inheritance (Section 2) Usage

Can be used in Section 2: Yes

Examples of allowed inheritance structures:
- Originating repository (e.g., "AAA") -> Direct fork (e.g., "AAA-plus") -> Subsequent forks (must retain "AAA" in the name)
- Originating repository (e.g., "AAA" at point A, "BBB" at point B) -> Direct fork created between A and B (e.g., "AAA-evolved") -> Subsequent forks (must retain "AAA" in the name)

## 3. Optional Inheritance (Section 5) Usage

Can be used in Section 5: Yes

Examples of allowed inheritance structures:
- Originating repository (e.g., "AAA") -> Direct fork (e.g., "AAA-plus", naming continuity obligation applies) -> Grandchild fork (naming continuity obligation is optional)
- Originating repository (e.g., "AAA" at point A, "BBB" at point B) -> Direct fork created after point B (e.g., "BBB-rebooted", naming continuity obligation applies) -> Grandchild fork (can choose to inherit from "AAA" or "BBB", or have no naming continuity obligation)
